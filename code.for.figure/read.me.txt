Steps to re-produce the figures:

1. Create a folder (name does not matter, suppose here I call it FOLDER1)
2. Create a RStudio project file in FOLDER1
3. Create a subfolder under FOLDER1 named client-side
4. Download all the code into the subfolder client-side
5. Download client.side.output.tar.gz (from Synapse under accession syn18404527) into subfolder client-side and de-compress
6. In the code files, I used ABSOLUTE path "~/Project/Cancer2CellLine". Please replace it with the ABSOLUTE path of FOLDER1.
7. Run the code. Section1(2,3,4,5).R are for the figures shown in the corresponding sections of results. round1(2,2.DE).R are for the figures shown in rebuttal letters.
